# Dishly Directory

This directory contains legacy HTML/CSS files from early development.

**Note:** The main Django application now uses templates in `Groq/templates/` instead.

## Contents

- `index.HTML` - Old homepage (replaced by `Groq/templates/Groq/index.html`)
- `reverse-recipe.HTML` - Old reverse recipe page (replaced by `Groq/templates/Groq/reverse.html`)
- `advanced-search.html` - Prototype for advanced search feature
- `format.py` - Response formatting utility (functionality now in `Groq/views.py`)
- CSS files - Styling for the old HTML pages

These files are kept for reference but are not used by the current application.
